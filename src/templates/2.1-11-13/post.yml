    I wanted to have a summary of the events from my Google calendar delivered to my inbox on a weekly basis. I wrote a short Google script to get the job done.

    [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/) is really great. All of Google Apps are easily to integrate with your code and it all runs in the browser.

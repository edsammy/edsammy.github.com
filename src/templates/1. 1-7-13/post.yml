:title: Site Upgrade
:date: 1.7.13
:body: |
    Welcome to my new website! It was built using [Bonsai](http://www.tinytree.info), a ruby based dynamic site generator.
    It is very easy to use and I would definitely recommend it to a friend.
    I also used [twitter bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) for some styling.

    This area of the site will feature small updates and informal projects while the projects section of the site will
    include (more or less) finalized projects.

    All the source code for the site can be found on [github](https://github.com/edsammy/edsammy.github.com).
